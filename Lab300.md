##### Search and Leverage Google Maps Plug-in

The way to use and get a plug in, is by getting one from a third party. 

There is a huge world where API's are developed -> apex.world.

When you are there, navigate to plug in's. You can see community built code for any APEX issue.

Search "Google Maps" in the Plug in details. Here you will see jk64SimpleMap (0.7) by Jeffrey Kemp. Download it and once you are done, navigate back to the APEX app builder. We are now at the point where you can start customizing the tracking map page. 

Now we are to create Regions ~~~~~

<!-- this is also in Lab 500. Should we also merge? -->

One for the ability to search and another for the Map itself. Right-click "Region" and select "Create Region". Name one "Search by Load number", and the second region "Map".

Now you want to upload the API. Click App Builder in the top left corner. Then click "Import" square box. Click "Choose File" and select the API download from your folders.

##### Download to Local CPU

<!-- what specifically do we want to dowload to local CPU and why should that go here?-->
