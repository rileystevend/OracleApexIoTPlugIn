##### Search and Leverage Google Maps Plug-in

The way to use and get a plug in, is by getting one from a third party. Third party plug in is a place you go outside of Oracle, to use community built code that many applications can use for repetitive functions. ##Plug ins are essential to using app builder faster.<!--what is a third party--> <!--FIGURE OUT COLOR CHANGE-->https://styleguide.github.com/primer/utilities/colors/#text-colors

There is a huge world where API's are developed -> apex.world. Apex world is _________????

When you are there, navigate to plug in's. You can see community built code for any APEX issue.

Search "Google" in the Plug in details. Here you will see jk64SimpleMap (0.7) by Jeffrey Kemp. This plug in will help with configuring the maps that are in google straight into APEX to help with the tracking.!--this plug in does ________-->

Download it and once you are done, navigate back to the APEX app builder. We are now at the point where you can start customizing the tracking map page without having to use too much code.

Now we are to create Regions. These regions will help with organizing the side bar of your page. Very similar to a table of contents. ~~~~~ <!--what is a region-->

<!-- this is also in Lab 500. Should we also merge? Yes -->

You will need one region for the ability to search and another for the Map itself. Right-click "Region" and select "Create Region". Name one "Search by Load number", and the second region "Map".

Now you want to upload the API. Click App Builder in the top left corner. Then click "Import" square box. Click "Choose File" and select the API download from your folders.

Fill out the google map plug in api key, and upload it to the application. You can now leverage it in any part of the app that you would need.

I am a little confused at 12:50, "in the search region, we need to add a page item"
