# Lab 500
## Update Blank Page
##### Create Two Regions, Search, and Map

Navigate to the APEX App Builder and begin customizing your Tracking Map Page. Here you can customize your app in a low code environment. Under Page 7: Tracking Map, click on a section titled "Regions". Navigate to "Create New Region". We will be creating two new Regions, Search and Map. 

(Here we will need to add screen shots of the steps and how to navigate the side bar.)

Once you click on "create new region" a section titled "Content Body" will appear. Navigate to the right of your screen and change the title under identification to "Search". Save.

(Need to show how to change title and save)

Repeat these steps but title the new region "Map" and save.


##### Add Search Field Dynamic Action that Refreshes Map



##### Add Map Plug-in to Map Region

Then you will need to upload the plugin that you previously downloaded. Navigate to "App Builder" at the top left of your screen. And select "Import". From import find the file "abc" and open it. Select File Type "Plug-in". Click Next to verify the file has been imported successfully. After you verify, click next again. Make sure the information matches the picture below (insert screenshot) and continue on. On this last part titled "Component Settings" you will need to give your Google API Key. Insert your Google API Key you got earlier in the lab. These are unique to each person. Select "Apply Changes". You Map Plug-in should now be uploaded in the application.

Now that you have uploaded your plugin we need to add it to your application. Navigat back to the Tracking Map Page and you can now begin to build out your tracking map page. In the Search region you created in Part 2 of this lab, add a new PAge Item. Call this new Item "LoadNumber".

NExt we need to add our plugin. Select "Map" and Navigate to the right side of the screen. Under "Identification" where you previously titled the item "Map" change "Type" to the plugin you just imported. Under "Source" for "Location" select "Local Database", for "Type" select "SQL Query".

In APEX, you do not have to write the query yourself. Use the query builder tool to select the columns from the table that you need and the query builder will create the SQL Query for you. Click on the "Tracking Data" table. Select "Latitude", "Longitude", "Carrier Name", "Description" and "Carrier Load Number".

Add a condition to Carrier Load Number. "=:P7_LOADNUMBER" for the load number variable. Select Return and you will see your SQL Query. It should look like this (Insert Screenshot).

We need to create one more part of the SQL Query. Return to the Query bulder by clicking the Hammer Icon. Select "Latitude", "Longitude", "Carrier Load Number", and "Description". Add a condition to Carrier Load Number. "=:P7_LOADNUMBER" for the load number variable. Select Return and you will see your SQL Query. It should look like this (Insert Screenshot).

Then "Submit" the new Page Item.

Lastly, create a button with a dynamic action so that once the load number is submitted, we get the map to refresh and display coordinates. Chane item "Load Number" to a number field. Right click and create button.

Create Button. Title is "Submit". Edit "Column" to "2". Edit "Column Span" to "1". And give it a dynamic action. This Dynamic Action will on a certain chained event in the model will initiate the load number to be searched and plotted on the map.Title a dynamic action. Title it "SubmitLoadNumber". Select "Show" change it to "Refresh" under Identification -> Action. Change Affected Elements -> Selection Type -> Region and Affected Elements -> Region -> Map

Save. Now we can check out application and see that we have a search field and a map.

##### Test App

Now we want to test the Application. Enter a load number and see if it plots. Enter "abc" and you should get this result (eneter screenshot).

You now know how to build a full delpoyed application in the cloud with ORacle Apex and the Google Maps API.
